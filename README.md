# python-logging

## Overview
This project will serve as reference material for how to implement logging in a python application. The project will consist of a simple Flask backend made for local development only (there may be future plans to deploy the application). The main goal is to assess the benefits and drawbacks of different logging implementations and evalutate the overhead associated with each method.
