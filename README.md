# Regilog
Regilog is a simple registration application that will save basic User information into a SQLite database. 

Regilog will ask Users for the following information:
* Email
* First Name
* Last Name

The main focus of the application is **not** on the registration process, but on the **logging** implementation that will be used for Regilog.

## Overview
This project will serve as reference material for how to implement logging in a python application. The project will consist of a simple Flask backend made for local development only (there may be future plans to deploy the application). The main goal is to assess the benefits and drawbacks of different logging implementations and evalutate the overhead associated with each method.
